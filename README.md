# About
Savor is a mobile application that is currently open for [beta testing](mailto:savor.beta.test@gmail.com). We are working hard to help with indecisiveness when it comes to coming up with a recipe to cook. Our app lets you easily find and explore over 50,000 recipes from a multitude of cultures so that you can Savor what you eat, while widening your kitchen repertoire. 

## Core Values
### *Food has no boundaries:*
Savor strives to be inspiring and all-inclusive. We accept people, and food, from all backgrounds and cultures. The Savor team loves consuming and recommending food from all over the world. We also work hard to make sure our application is accessible for people that have any dietary requirements.

### *Taste has no limits:*
Food is not limited to just tasting good, it can also be a springboard for you to improve your own life and your surroundings. We believe you can achieve anything you put your mind to. This applies to life and the food you cook. We hope that Savor can help you push your limits and grow as a cook.

### *Swipe and look:*
It's really that simple. Savor was built upon simplicity, efficiency and, delivering a great user experience will always be our top priority. Signing up is not required to get started. Although, once you create an account, you will receive a very personalized experience. 

### *Savor to cook:*
Last but not least, we’d like you to Savor what you eat. We challenge you to be mindful of your eating habits and, to cherish the food you prepare and consume. There is something very special about picking out and preparing your own ingredients, experiencing the act of cooking with all of your senses and, tasting the masterpiece of your own creations.

# Coming Soon
### Going-Out Mode
- Currently, our application is in *Staying-In Mode*. This means you are able to swipe left or right on recipes to prepare at home. Imagine the ability to swipe left or right on restaurants in your current location and, Savoring your favorite restaurants!
### Enhanced Machine Learning
- Our machine learning model used for the *Smart Recommendation* feature currently takes into account previously Savored recipe information such as, ingredients. We hope to enhance our machine learning model to use time relevant features such as, time-of-day, day-of-week, holidays, etc. For example, if you're a strong believer in Taco-Tuesday, don't be surprised if you start to see taco recipes on Tuesday night!
### Food Lovers Network
- This would be a simple way to connect with your friends/family on Savor. Share Savored recipes, see what your friends are cooking and, get ready for a more complete profile page!
